## Misc
This simple module fetches content stored in the edition's
own database using a docid so it can be embedded in a page
without all the Drupal templating and without having to 
access Drupal's arcane database structure.

This has the advantage that the miscellaneous files can
be backed up along with the rest of the edition.
