## Para (formerly Misc)
This simple module fetches content stored in the edition's
own database using a docid so it can be embedded in a page
without all the Drupal templating and without having to 
access Drupal's arcane database structure.

This has the advantage that the miscellaneous files can
be backed up along with the rest of the edition.

The name was changed to Para because in Drupal there is a 
folder misc in the top level that it was getting confused with.
'Para' means 'paratextual'.
