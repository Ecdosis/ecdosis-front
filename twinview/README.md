Twinview is a front-end module for viewing manuscript, newspaper and 
letter sources in a twin panel with images of the pages on the left and 
formatted HTML on the right. Versions and layers can be selected. Layers 
will be shown in grey with changes in red or blue to indicate changes 
from the previous layer.
