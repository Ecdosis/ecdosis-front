Twinview is a front-end module for viewing manuscript, newspaper and letter sources 
in a twin panel display with a scrolling list of page-images on the left and 
formatted HTML on the right. Versions and layers can be selected. Layers will be 
shown in grey with changes in red or blue to indicate changes from the previous 
layer.
