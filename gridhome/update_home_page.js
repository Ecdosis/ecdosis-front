db.misc.insert({ "body" : "The CHCA is a digital archive *and* a  scholarly edition of the poetic works of Charles Harpur (1813-68), the  most important poet of colonial New South Wales. A Romantic celebrator  of Australian landscape, a political satirist, a love poet and early  environmentalist, Harpur and his works remain relevant today. But they  are not easily accessible. \n\nThis is because Harpur was a prolific poet and an inveterate reviser.  Extant today in manuscript, and in colonial newspaper and other printed  forms, are nearly 2,700 versions of his 680 works in verse, as well as the  often fascinating prose notes that he wrote for them. Most of these  versions have never been published â€“ until now.\n\nUse the Browse menu to [start exploring the poems](/harpur/tabs?tabset=browse), but it is a good idea to read the brief [Overview of the CHCA](/harpur/tabs?tabset=about) first, or the much fuller Introduction below.\n\nIntroduction to the CHCA:\n\n  * [Archival and editorial policy](/harpur/tabs?tabset=about&module=para%3Fdocid%3Denglish/harpur/about/editorial) \n  * [Technical design](/harpur/tabs?tabset=about&module=para%3Fdocid%3Denglish/harpur/about/technical) \n  * [Permissions, rights and acknowledgements](/harpur/tabs?tabset=about&module=para%3Fdocid%3Denglish/harpur/about/permissions) \n\nThis site remains under development. Materials in it should not be quoted until the site's formal publication, expected in early-2017. As at this date the documentary transcriptions have been checked but the establishment of edited reading texts with commentary has only recently begun. The transcriptions, especially of manuscripts, often contain unresolved readings.\n", "format" : "text/x-markdown", "docid" : "english/harpur/home" });
